The mobile game MathCrusher combines the complexity of arithmetical calculations with the intensity of an endless runner, resulting in a highly addictive gameplay that is both fun and educational.

My first published game (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mathcrusher/id1334772802?mt=8">iOS</a> & <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DRK4OZ.MathCrusher">Android</a>). While being a personal learning experience -- and thus containing various spaghetti-code belonging to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/">r/programminghorror</a> -- it still has a handful of useful methods and techniques including touch controls, collision detection mechanisms, and cross-platform/multiple devices utility.
